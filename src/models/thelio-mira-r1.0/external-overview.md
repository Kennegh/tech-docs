### Other Notes:

- The Thelio Mira shown in the picture above is a prototype and is missing the 1u cutout for the bottom PCIe x16 slot. Your Thelio Mira will have this slot cut out.
- The BIOS Flash button is not needed when performing UEFI firmware updates via the System76 Firmware Manager. Use of the BIOS Flash button is not recommended.
- The upper HDMI and DisplayPort ports will only work if your CPU supports integrated graphics (for example, the AMD Ryzen 3 3200G or Ryzen 5 3400G.) In most configurations, you should use the display outputs on your graphics card if one is installed.
