# Launch (Usage & Customization)

The Launch Configurable Keyboard can be customized and personalized in a variety of ways. It is recommended to remove unplug all USB cables and devices from your Launch before changing keycaps or switches.

## Connecting and Using Launch

![Launch ports](./img/launch-ports.png)

Using either the USB-C to USB-C cable or the USB-A to USB-C cable, connect to your computer via your Launch's center USB type C port. Due to the directionality of USB, your Launch will only work when connected to your computer via the center port. Launch should now be ready to type on, and the USB ports on the back are ready to connect devices to.

## Removing and Installing Keycaps

Launch uses only three sizes of uniform profile keycaps, which allows for a high degree of customization. Any two keycaps of the same size can be swapped on the keyboard, and several extras are included in the box. 

To remove a keycap, separate the two wire loops of the included keycap and switch removal tool and place them around two opposite corners of the keycap to be removed. Pull slowly but firmly on the keycap until it slides off the switch's stem.

The included keycap puller works on all three of Launch's keycap sizes. The three 2U caps (both space bars and left shift) have stabilizers, so be sure to pull both sides evenly. They will take a little more pulling force than the rest of the keycaps, but they will come off in the same way.

To install a keycap, position it on the switch and press down firmly. The key caps friction fit onto the switch stems, so the only thing to worry about is whether the keycap is pressed down all the way onto the switch. Since the 2U keycaps also have stabilizers, they will require a bit more pressure to install.

## Removing and installing switches

Since Launch uses Kailh hot swap sockets, key switches can be removed and installed without soldering. 

**Note:** If you are changing all of the switches in your Launch, it is recommended to completely [remove the PCB](#removing-the-pcb), install the switches into the top case without the PCB, then install the PCB into the case and onto the switch pins.

To remove a switch, place the two tongs of the switch removal tool onto the switch's locking tabs on the top and bottom edges of the switch. The hooks should squeeze the white tabs in and hook under the switch's clear plastic top housing. Pinch the tongs together a little to help release the switch's locking clips from the cutout in the top case, and pull the switch upwards out of the socket. The switch's locking tabs can sometimes bind on the edges of the top case cutouts, so if the switch feels stuck, remove the tool and press the switch back down into place, then try removing it again. Switches take more force to remove than keycaps.

When installing a switch, it is important to first make sure the switch's pins are straight. The pins have to plug into the socket, and they'll miss their slots if they are bent.

![Straighten switch pins](./img/switch-install-pins-straight.jpg)

The switch should be oriented so that the clear LED shine-through window is towards the top of the socket, where the LED is located on the PCB.

![Switch orientation](./img/switch-install-orientation.jpg)

Place the switch straight into the plate. You should be able to feel whether the pins are plugging into the socket correctly. 

**Note:** Forcing the pins into the hot swap socket could damage the PCB. If you feel excessive resistance, pull the switch out, double-check that the pins are straight, and try installing the switch again.

Once you feel the pins plugging into the hot swap socket, press the switch down with more force to snap it into place in the chassis.

## Removing the PCB

If the PCB in your Launch ever becomes damaged, it can be replaced using these instructions. It is also recommended to completely remove the PCB if you are changing all of the switches on your Launch at the same time. This makes switch installation much easier and makes it much less likely to bend switch pins or damage the PCB.

Begin by [removing all of the keycaps](#removing-and-installing-keycaps), and then [remove all of the switches](#removing-and-installing-switches). Next, turn the keyboard over and remove the eight screws that hold on the bottom panel and remove the bottom panel. Lifting the bottom panel out of the chassis may be easier with the magnetic lift bar installed.

Push the PCB up out of the chassis through one of the switch holes, then lift the PCB out of the chassis.

When reassembling your Launch, it is recommended to first install all of the switches into the chassis before installing the PCB. Installing switches this way is much easier since you don't have to worry about aligning the pins at the same time.

![Installing switches into chassis](./img/switch-install-without-pcb.jpg)

Once all of the switches are installed in the chassis, turn the chassis over and check that all of the switch pins are straight. It helps to look down the rows of pins from the sides of the chassis. If any of the pins are bent when installing the PCB, the switch or the PCB may get damaged. The pin circled in red in the image below is an example of a pin that is bent and needs to be straightened.

![Checking switch pins in chassis](./img/switch-pin-check-in-chassis.jpg)

Carefully line up the PCB with the switch pins and place it in the chassis. It may be easiest to insert the top edge first since the USB-C ports need to go into the port cutouts in the chassis. If all of the switch pins feel lined up, press the PCB down little by little until all of the switch pins are fully seated in their sockets. The switch pins can be seen coming up through the sockets when they are fully seated (circled in green below).

Finally, install the bottom cover and its eight screws, flip the keyboard over, and put all keycaps back on.
