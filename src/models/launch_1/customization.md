# Launch (Usage & Customization)

The Launch Configurable Keyboard can be customized and personalized in a variety of ways. It is recommended to remove unplug all USB cables and devices from your Launch before changing keycaps or switches.

## Connecting and Using Launch

Using either the USB-C to USB-C cable or the USB-A to USB-C cable, connect to your computer via your Launch's center USB type C port. Due to the directionality of USB, your Launch will only work when connected to your computer via the center port. Launch should now be ready to type on, and the USB ports on the back are ready to connect devices to.

## Removing and Installing Keycaps

Launch uses only three sizes of uniform profile keycaps, which allows for a high degree of customization. Any two keycaps of the same size can be swapped on the keyboard, and several extras are included in the box. 

Separate the two wire loops of the included keycap and switch removal tool and place them around the corners of the keycap to be removed. Pull slowly but firmly on the keycap until it slides off the switch's stem.

This keycap puller works on all keycap sizes. The three 2U caps (both space bars and left shift) have stabilizers, so be sure to pull both sides evenly. They will take a little more pulling force than the rest of the keycaps, but they will come off in the same way.
